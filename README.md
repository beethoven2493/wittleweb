# wittleweb

WittleWeb is a java wrapper around Sun's HttpServer. It provides:
- Request/response semantics
- Authentication via pluggable login page
- File serving
- Servlet pluggability

Queries get decontextualized for servlets' ease of parsing and relocatability.

It is usable from any java application.
